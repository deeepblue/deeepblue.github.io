The products and values associated with this illusion are however just as bound for decay as the human bodies employed in their production. Plying the absurdity of this common denomination, whereby life is born into death, and form is derived from the material remains of what came before, Samuel Beckett remarked that “the end is in the beginning and yet you go on.” While never fully escaping the tragedy of the human condition, Beckett viewed the role of the artist as “finding a form that accommodates the mess.”Through moving images and prints produced in stereoscopic 3-D, the works presented in (Untitled but Unnamed) are the result of artist Paul Kajander's research into biographical details surrounding Beckett’s formative years in Foxrock, Dublin and subsequent expatriation from Ireland.Paul Kajander was born in Vancouver and is currently living in Los Angeles.  His work in visual art and sound has recently been presented at the Hammer Museum (LA), the Daniel Faria Gallery (Toronto), the Seoul Museum of Art (Seoul) and ArtSonje Center (Seoul).  In 2014 he scored music and foley for Isabelle Pauwels' ",000," commissioned by the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (Troy).  Curated by Robin SelkNote: All the works on view require the use of anaglyphic blue/red 3-D glasses, which will be distributed 30 minutes prior to screening times.Screening times, November 26th:7:30pm, 8:20pm, 9:10pmScreening times, November 27th and 28th: 7:30pm, 8:20pmWe acknowledge the support of the Canada Council for the Arts, which last year invested $153 million to bring the arts to Canadians throughout the country.Nous remercions le Conseil des arts du Canada de son soutien.
