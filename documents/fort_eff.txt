A researcher, a dope smoker and a frightful temptress walk into a bar...
In a roadside dive off Highway 97, a group of young dropouts welcome a delirious stranger into their midst, becoming the subjects of his drug-fuelled experiments. A love story about the language of desire, delusion, seduction, research, drugs, alcohol, money and power, Fort Eff is the desperate attempt of individuals to understand and be understood by their environmental constituents.
